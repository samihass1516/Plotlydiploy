# Plotlydiploy
## Background:
In this challenge, we had to build an Interactive dashboard using plotly.js and JavaScript.  Plotly.js a JavaScript data visualization library and JavaScript are two great data that are exactly what we needed to explore and visualize data on the human bellybutton biodiversity with also an interactive environment deployed.
In this challenge, we are going to be able to:
•	Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
•	Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
•	Parse data in JSON format.
•	Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
•	Use JavaScript's Math library to manipulate numbers.
•	Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to data visualization.
•	How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
•	Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Challenge:

In Deliverable One, we had to create a Horizontal Bar Chart:

1.	Used D3 library Samples,json
2.	We created a drop-down menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that induvial.
3.	Used sample_values for the values in the bar chart.
4.	Used otu_IDs as labels for the bar chart. 
5.	Used otu_labels as hover texts for the bar chart.

In Deliverable Two, we had to create a Bubble Chart:
	. used otu_IDs for the x values and marker colors.
	. used sample_values for y values and marker sizes.
	. used otu_labels for text values.

In deliverable three, we had to create a Gauge Chart:
	. I required help to create the gauge chart from the Gauge charts in JavaScript (plotly.com).
	. Set the gauge chart range at a maximum of 10.
	. Set the color of the chart using the  Matplotlib 3.1.0 documentation.
